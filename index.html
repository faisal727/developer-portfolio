            <h3>Dream to a Web developer and an Engineer</h3>
            <p>Mobile app development is the act or process by which a mobile app is developed for mobile devices, such
                as
                personal digital assistants, enterprise digital assistants or mobile phones. These software applications
                are
                designed to run on mobile devices, such as a smartphone or tablet computer. These applications can be
                pre-installed on phones during manufacturing platforms, or delivered as web applications using
                server-side
                or client-side processing (e.g., JavaScript) to provide an "application-like" experience within a web
                browser.</p>
